Encapsulation: Combination of data and actions related to an object (A bank account having a balance, an account name and deposit/withdraw options)

Composition: What a 'thing' is made out of (a car being a combination of parts)

Aggregation: What can be combined with a 'thing'. Combinging multiple 'things' to create a new 'component' (Person In Seat of Car becomes Driver).

Inheritence: Hierachal relationship between 'things' and 'stuff' dervied from 'things'.

Abstraction: Something which describes a 'thing' without implementing the 'thing'.

Polymorphism: Allowing a 'thing' which derives from another 'thing' to override some of that it can do, AKA: BS magic.
