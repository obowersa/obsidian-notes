Different collection types have different methods

- List
	- Add/Insert
	- Remove/RemoveAt
	- As lists are ordered, they support adding/removing from the end, or, adding/removing specific areas

- Dictionairy
	- Add
	- Remove
	- Dictionairies are not ordered. So you can add/remove and check if something exists using ContainsKey

- Stack
	- Push
	- Pop
	- Stacks are LIFO so you can simply push and pop from them

- Queue
	- Enqueue
	- Dequeue
	- Queues are FIFO so you can add to the end and remove from the start, they also support peek to see a value without removing
