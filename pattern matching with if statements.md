Pattern matching with if statements was introduced in C# 7.0's language spec

This looks like:
```
if(something is something else)
```

pattern matching can also be used with the switch statement

```
// string path = "/Users/markjprice/Code/Chapter03";
string path = @"C:\Code\Chapter03";
Write("Press R for read-only or W for writeable: "); 
ConsoleKeyInfo key = ReadKey();
WriteLine();
Stream? s;
if (key.Key == ConsoleKey.R)
{
  s =  File.Open(
    Path.Combine(path, "file.txt"), 
    FileMode.OpenOrCreate, 
    FileAccess.Read);
}
else
{
  s =  File.Open( 
    Path.Combine(path, "file.txt"), 
    FileMode.OpenOrCreate, 
    FileAccess.Write);
}
string message; 
switch (s)
{
  case FileStream writeableFile when s.CanWrite:
    message = "The stream is a file that I can write to.";
    break;
  case FileStream readOnlyFile:
    message = "The stream is a read-only file.";
    break;
  case MemoryStream ms:
    message = "The stream is a memory address.";
    break;
  default: // always evaluated last despite its current position
    message = "The stream is some other type.";
    break;
  case null:
    message = "The stream is null.";
    break;
}
WriteLine(message); 
```
