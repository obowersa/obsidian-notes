Kind of a placeholder

Generics were introduced in 2.0

Strongly typed collection of things.

Just know for now:
using System.Collections.Generic; // List\<T>

Generics were added as a way to pass types as parameters, similar to passing objects as paramaters.

An example of use is something which can take any type, but, when instantiated is restrcted to only that type

---
General advise is to avoid types in the Systems.Collections namespace

System.Collections.Generic.Dictionary\<TKey, TValue>
