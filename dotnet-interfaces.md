Interfaces are like the studs on top a lego brick. They let you stick together different types to make new things

interfaces acted as fixed contracts

---
There are implicit and explicit interface implementations
Explicit interfaces are used when you have multiple interfaces with the same signature but need to provide different implementations. This can be done using the Interfacename.method call

interfaces can be declared using the 'interface' keyword


---

interfaces are mapped to a class using the same inheritence system as used for class inheritence (classname: Isomething)
