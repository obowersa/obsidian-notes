	- Constant: The data never changes
	- ReadOnly: The data doesnt change once initialised, but, can be loaded/calculated at the time of initialisation
	- Event: Referemces one or more methods that you want to execute when something happens
- Methods: Used to execute statements. Like functions but belong to a class. There are four specialised categories
	- Constructor: Executes when you use the new keyword
