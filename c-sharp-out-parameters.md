Csharp supports an 'out' parameter

This is difference from the normal input/ref stuff

Out is output only, is defined by out \<name> and must be initialised in the method

From c-sharp 7.0, you can simplify the out parameter definition . Instead of defining it before using you can use an inline declaration.
